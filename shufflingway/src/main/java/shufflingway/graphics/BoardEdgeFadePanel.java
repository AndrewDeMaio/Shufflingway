/**
 * A player's zone backdrop: flat element colour over most of its height, fading to the board's
 * neutral tone over the last {@code fadeHeight} pixels of its centre-facing edge.
 *
 * <p>The board gradient used to live entirely in the strip between the two zones. That strip is
 * whatever the zones leave over — a few dozen pixels at best, and far less once a zone grows — and
 * a gradient with no room to fade reads as a hard bright line rather than a horizon. Fading inside
 * the zone itself gives it as much room as it needs, and lets the gradient begin above the Forward
 * row's scrollbar so the bar sits over the board rather than over flat colour.
 *
 * <p>Only the far side is flat, so the zone's own furniture — deck, Break Zone, damage — still sits
 * on solid colour. Whatever occupies the fade region must be non-opaque for the fade to show
 * through; the Forward zone's scroll pane and its inner panels already are.
 *
 * <p>{@code fadeAtBottom} names the centre-facing edge: true for the top seat (P2, centre is below
 * it), false for the bottom seat (P1).
